With a decade of experience in the technology field, I have developed a strong proficiency in building comprehensive SaaS applications.

My expertise spans the full development lifecycle, including system design, frontend and backend logic development, testing, deployment, and basic server management. Recently, I have focused on enhancing my design workflows, with a particular preference for using Figma as my primary design tool. 

My experience allows me to create robust, scalable solutions while maintaining a strong focus on quality and performance at every stage of the development process.
